Convolutional Neural Networks (also referred to throughout this thesis as 'CNNs') are a massive step that was taken in the field of computer vision. These CNN's were, and still are to this day, the foundation of computer vision models \cite{deeplearning}. In this section, we will evaluate how these kinds of models are typically constructed, as well as how they have been adapted to use modern techniques. In addition, these kinds of CNN models will be used further in chapter \ref{Methodology}, where we examine the models used with our novel representation.
