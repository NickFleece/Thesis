%Human action recognition is a very difficult task and is a constantly evolving topic of research in the computer vision community. In the real world, human action recognition has many issues, not limited to things such as occlusion, cluttered and dynamic backgrounds, camera motion, and multiview variations \cite{recognitionchallenges}. Existing classical models \cite{i3d} are vulnerable to these variables in the real world. The extraction of different features has tried to mitigate these background influences, such as rgb flow \cite{rgbflow}, however these can still be influenced by motion in the background. The emergence of lightweight, high quality pose estimation \cite{openpose} has allowed for accurate skeleton data from nearly every video in the wild, and utilizing this skeleton data, the background factors can be mitigated.

%This paper aims to mitigate these background factors, while providing a model that provides high-quality action recognition prediction at near state of the art performance.  This involves constructing an intermediate representation using exclusively 2D pose data. With this representation, we aim to remove as much background influence as possible, thus our representation is independent of global position, or global rotation of the subject performing the action. The architecture of this representation was greatly inspired by \cite{simple_yet_efficient}, however their implementation suffers from largely relying on the global position of the person, which can reduce in the wild accuracy outside of curated datasets.


People interact with their environment in unique and nuanced ways, 

\section{Action Recognition}

For humans, the problem of Human Action Recognition is rather simple. We use past experiences throughout childhood and adult life to be able to pick out the various ways a person moves, and translate that into a familiar action that we have seen before. Combine that with objects that a person may be interacting with, and humans are remarkably good at discerning what actions other humans are involved in. However, as is with most things in the domain of computer vision, this ability does not translate well into the realm of artificial intelligence. The slightly different ways that people may perform these tasks add a layer of complexity that is difficult for a model to overcome.
